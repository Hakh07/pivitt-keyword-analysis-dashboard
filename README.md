# pivitt-keyword-analysis-dashboard

This project analyses keyword search data to identify the best budget allocation opportunities for Pivitt’s services:
- Branding/Rebranding
- Brand Consulting
- Brand Management
- Digital Experiences

## Dashboard Overview
The Power BI dashboard includes:
- **Search Demand by Service Category** (bar chart)
- **Cost vs Competition** (scatter plot with bubble size = demand)
- **Top Keywords by Opportunity Score** (ranked table)
- **Interactive slicer** (filter by service category)

## Key Insights
- A large portion of demand sits in **Other/Generic** terms, but these are broad and less targeted.
- **Brand Management** has the highest targeted demand (10k+ monthly searches).
- **Brand Consulting** terms are lower in volume but highly strategic (niche, high-value keywords).
- **Digital Experiences** show low demand but carry higher CPC (expensive space).
